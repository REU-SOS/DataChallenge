[Product Hunt](https://www.producthunt.com) is a community that curates collections of new startups, tech products, and apps. A user can post a new product or collection of products. These posts and collections can be voted on by other users. Each post can also contain comments about the product.

**Some basic statistics**

The data consists of about 1G of uncompressed data, in organized in several csv files.

* 20 million following relations
* 3.4 million vote events
* 508,705 users
* 31,364 product posts
* 98,544 product collections
* 574,469 products/collections relations

#### Data Challenge Guidelines

* You can do anything you want that uses this data.
* You can supplement this data with any other sources of data.
* You will commit your code and results in a github repo.
* You should integrate techniques and tools we learn in our workshops as much as possible.
* You will present your results on Friday afternoon using a [Pecha Kucha](http://www.pechakucha.org/) inspired format.

#### Example result

Just to give you one idea of an example project, Sam used this data to train a [startup generator](https://github.com/alt-code/Research/blob/master/pdfs/StartupBot%2048-36.pdf), which randomly creates a new startup landing page.
