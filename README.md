[Product Hunt](https://www.producthunt.com) is a community that curates collections of new startups, tech products, and apps. A user can post a new product or collection of products. These posts and collections can be voted on by other users. Each post can also contain comments about the product.

**Some basic statistics**

The data consists of about 1G of uncompressed data, in organized in several csv files.

* 20 million following relations
* 3.4 million vote events
* 508,705 users
* 31,364 product posts
* 98,544 product collections
* 574,469 products/collections relations

#### Data Challenge Guidelines

* You can do anything you want that uses this data.
* You can supplement this data with any other sources of data.
* You will commit your code and results in a github repo.
* You should integrate techniques and tools we learn in our workshops as much as possible.
* You will present your results on Friday afternoon using a [Pecha Kucha](http://www.pechakucha.org/) inspired format. See presentation guidelines below.

#### Example result

Just to give you one idea of an example project, Sam used this data to train a [startup generator](https://twitter.com/dailystartupbot), which randomly creates a new startup landing page.

Another example analysis. Best time to post on reddit.

## Tim's Presentation Tips

PechaKucha or Pecha Kucha (Japanese: ペチャクチャ, IPA: [petɕa ku͍̥tɕa],[1] chit-chat) is a presentation style in which 20 slides are shown for 20 seconds each (6 minutes and 40 seconds in total). The format, which keeps presentations concise and fast-paced, powers multiple-speaker events.

#### Tips: http://www.buzzmaven.com/2010/03/pucha-kucha.html
Examples:

* http://www.pechakucha.org/presentations/data-science-for-social-good/play
* https://doublebyteblog.wordpress.com/2016/02/20/spatial-data-mining/

#### Tools (nothing hard):

* Google slides.
   * Publish
   * Set auto-advance to 20 seconds
   * Set auto-start

#### Hints: Google URLs are kinda evil.

* Get a tiny.cc account (its free)
* Start using your name (e.g. "timm"); and add a number http://tiny.cc/timm4
* When you tell people about your work, give them your name and number (e.g. "timm4").
